If you thought I would only have one emoji related project, then you'd be wrong. The less popular (although I think much cooler) sister of Emoji Fortunes is [Emoji Haikus](http://emojihaikus.lukecod.es)! Also it's built on the same [two](https://github.com/lukekarrys/emoji-named-characters) [modules](https://github.com/lukekarrys/random-emoji) which basically single-handedly validates the tiny modules philosophy.
