Geohashing, introduced by [xkcd #26](https://xkcd.com/426/), is a spontaneous adventure generator based on the stock market and md5 and graticules (oh my!). I've been fascinated by it since it was announced in 2008, but it took until 2015 for me to write a [geohashing CLI](https://github.com/lukekarrys/geohash-cli) and React Native [iOS app](https://github.com/lukekarrys/geohashing-ios)to find the day's coordinates. This is exactly as cool as it sounds. Both projects are backed by the [same](https://github.com/lukekarrys/djia) [set](https://github.com/lukekarrys/hex-frac-dec-frac) [of](https://github.com/lukekarrys/geo-graticule) [modules](https://github.com/lukekarrys/geohash-coordinates).
