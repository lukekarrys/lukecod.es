Imagine if someone took an unflattering picture of you every time your played a chess move. That's the [GifChess Club](http://gifchess.club)! A finalist at the [2015 Static Showdown](http://2015.staticshowdown.com/winners) and I published the base component for the [state](https://github.com/lukekarrys/ampersand-chess-state) and the [view](https://github.com/lukekarrys/ampersand-chess-view) separately.
