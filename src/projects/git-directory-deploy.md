I love GitHub Pages, but there can be a few annoyances around my normal workflow of developing a site in a master branch, compiling static files to a directory and then pushing that directory to a gh-pages branch. [git-directory-deploy](http://github.com/lukekarrys/git-directory-deploy) is really just a wrapper for [the original shell script](https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy) that fit my criteria, and adapted to be npm installable to fit my usual workflow.
