A CLI utility to take a series of interconnected GPX files and output them as [a single GPX file](https://github.com/lukekarrys/gpx-route-inspector/blob/master/examples/santan/output.geojson) with instructions to cover the shortest path through all the routes. In graph theory language that would be the shortest closed circuit that visited every edge of the unidrected graph, but as someone who never learned much graph theory I prefer to think of it as a way to run a see a whole bunch of different stuff while I run in one area.
