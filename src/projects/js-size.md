Perf matters and JS bytes over the wire is a big part of that. [js-size](https://github.com/lukekarrys/js-size) works as a CLI and JS module to take a JS file and output the minified gzipped size. Useful when combined with curl and [wzrd.in](https://wzrd.in/): curl -s https://wzrd.in/standalone/local-links | js-size.
