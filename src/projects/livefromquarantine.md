Some musicians I like have been doing daily or weekly streams from home so I built this site to make it easy to jump between songs in different videos. (Over-)engineering the automated data pipeline to preload <a href="https://livefromquarantine.club/bengibbard">multiple</a> <a href="https://livefromquarantine.club/benfolds">artists</a> has been a fun distraction right now. I also used it as an excuse to learn how state machines and TypeScript work together and that was a wild ride.
