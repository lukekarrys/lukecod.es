Browsers have quirks. Some of those quirks are around looking at internal links within a page and determining when to override them if you're building a native web app. [local-links](https://github.com/lukekarrys/local-link) wants to be your friend and not make you think about those quirks ever again. It has automated tests for the supported browser matrix so I know when I break stuff (which I've done before).
