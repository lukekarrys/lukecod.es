[moonboots](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/moonboots) is a tool I've contributed to for streamlining a set of conventions for the server-side of building native web apps. [moonboots-static](http://github.com/lukekarrys/moonboots-static) and [moonboots-express](http://github.com/lukekarrys/moonboots-express) are two plugins I wrote for moonboots to wrap those conventions in my usual workflow of a simple dev server and then writing a directory of static files. This all uses [browserify](http://browserify.org/) under the hood, but I've really been enjoying [webpack](webpack.github.io) lately, so moonboots isn't my primary tool for this anymore.
