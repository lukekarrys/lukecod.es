If you've been releasing modules on npm for awhile (especially if you started before [npm@2.0.0](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/98131109725/npm-2-0-0)) you might have a bunch of modules at v0.x.y and you might want to change that. Well I did, so I made the [npm-v0-finder](http://v0.lukecod.es) (catchy, I know) to help find the offending modules. Note that this was awhile ago and now npm lists [all versions on a user's page](https://www.npmjs.com/~lukekarrys), but if you have more than 1 page of modules this can still save you some clicks.
