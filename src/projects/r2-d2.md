One time I spent a few weeks figuring out Asterisk and ordering parts so I could make a socket.io signaling server ring my [R2-D2](http://lukecod.es/2014/03/28/beep-boop-ringing-an-r2d2-telephone-with-obihai-asterisk-and-node/) telephone. It remains one of my proudest achievements that I never use.
