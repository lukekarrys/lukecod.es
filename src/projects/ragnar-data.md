There are a lot of different [Ragnar](https://www.runragnar.com/) races, and one day I got semi-obsessed with sorting them based on criteria like elevation gain and total mileage. There wasn't an easy way to do that on their website, so I built [ragnar-data](https://github.com/lukekarrys/ragnar-data) so I could fetch, format, filter, sort, and cache all that data.
