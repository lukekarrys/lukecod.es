So yeah, .club domains were on sale for \$2.88 a year, and who doesn't want to be part of a club? So I made the [repeatone.club](http://repeatone.club) for people who want to show that they listen to the same song on repeat. Pulling data from [last.fm](http://last.fm) with a [webtask](https://github.com/lukekarrys/repeatone-webtask) acting as the API, it tries to make the output pretty by blurring the album artwork and pulling high contrast colors from it for the text.
