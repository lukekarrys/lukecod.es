I used to be a private Strava person, but then I realized I loved trying to get on segment leaderboards so I wanted to make them all public. So I built a [bulk editing plugin](http://lukecod.es/2016/09/20/bulk-edit-strava-activities/) because I wanted other people to be able to do the same (and I don't like clicking a mouse over and over).
