Run this as part of your continuous deployment workflow when using [Surge](https://surge.sh) to [teardown merged branches](https://github.com/lukekarrys/surge-teardown-branches). Works great if you deploy to feature branches, but don't want your Surge account littered with the ghosts of features past.
