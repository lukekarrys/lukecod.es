Host your own static Instagram site with [USI](https://github.com/lukekarrys/universal-static-instagram)! Why? Well, [reasons](https://github.com/lukekarrys/universal-static-instagram#what-is-this). Built to be a fully universal (aka isomorphic) JS app with React and Webpack. I think it's pretty neat. If all you want is your Instagram data and pictures, check out the backing library [instagram-download](#instagram-download).
